### Data-Driven Diagnostics
I analyzed user journey friction points through several lenses:
* **Google Analytics Audit**: Identified that 56% of traffic appeared as "(not set)," obscuring attribution and navigation data.
* **Behavioral Analysis**: Used Stripe subscription logs and BrightTALK sentiment data to map the "first-time speaker" walkthrough.

### Technical Innovation: The Speaker "Fit Score"
To solve the friction between speakers and event organizers, we proposed an **NLP-driven matching engine**.
* **The Model**: Utilized TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to rank speaker profiles against event descriptions.
* **UX Redesign**: Suggested a 10-point improvement plan to streamline onboarding and increase cross-platform integration.
