### Key Technical Contributions
* **Vector Architecture**: Engineered multi-index stores in **Weaviate** to isolate sensitive healthcare documentation from public data feeds.
* **Data Processing**: Automated the ingestion of large-scale datasets using custom Python scrapers and OpenAI's "text-embedding-3-large" model.
* **Deployment**: Integrated the Aparavi parsing toolchain and deployed a real-time interface on **Hugging Face**.
