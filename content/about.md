### The Bridge Between Engineering, AI & Finance
I am a **Software Engineer** and current **Dual Master’s candidate in Business Analytics and Finance** at Hult International Business School. My career is defined by building mission-critical systems—from architecting real-time liquidity pipelines for global banks to developing RAG-based AI agents that transform unstructured data into actionable insights.

### Professional Foundation: 3 Years at TCS
Before moving to the U.S., I spent three years at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** as a Systems Engineer for **SEI Investments**. I acted as a technical bridge between C-level banking requirements and data engineering for Tier-1 clients including **US Bank and HSBC**.

* **Architectural Modernization:** Transitioned legacy batch-processing systems to real-time **Kafka pipelines**, managing 1M+ daily transactions with 99.9% data integrity.
* **Leadership:** Served as a Forward Deployed Lead, translating business roadmaps into technical tasks and mentoring a team of five engineers.
* **Performance:** Awarded **Delivery Excellence**, **Rising Star**, and **Emerging Talent** honors for full-stack contributions.

### High Performance: The Hult 4x Winning Streak
At Hult, I have consistently ranked in the **top 3%** of my program for strategic advisory and technical innovation. I am a **4-time Business Challenge Winner** across multiple domains:

* **Climate Risk:** Engineered a GIS-integrated ESG pipeline that reduced manual data collection from 3 days to under 1 hour.
* **AI Innovation:** Won 1st Place in the **Aparavi Innovation Challenge** for architectural excellence in RAG development.
* **Retail Automation:** Awarded **"Most Practical AI Application"** for an MVP integrating **YOLOv8** with a high-availability **Spring Boot** backend.

### Technical Toolkit
* **Languages & Frameworks:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Java (Spring Boot), R (Shiny), SQL, PL/SQL.
* **Data & AI:** LangChain, Weaviate (Vector DB), Kafka, PySpark, Computer Vision (YOLOv8).
* **Cloud & Tools:** AWS (Glue, Athena, S3), Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Power BI.

### Beyond the Code
When I’m not building data pipelines, you’ll find me exploring the **Boston** food scene, following the **NBA and Premier League**, or experimenting with my **Moka Pot** for the perfect cup of coffee.
