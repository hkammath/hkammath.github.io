### The Bridge Between Engineering & Finance
I am a Software Engineer and current **Dual Master’s candidate in Business Analytics and Finance** at Hult International Business School. My career is defined by building "mission-critical" systems—whether it’s architecting real-time liquidity pipelines for global banks or developing RAG-based AI agents for unstructured healthcare data.

### Professional Foundation: 3 Years at TCS
Before moving to Boston for my Master's, I spent three years at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** as a Systems Engineer. I led technical teams to modernize legacy banking infrastructures for Tier-1 clients including **HSBC and US Bank**. 

* **The Impact:** I transitioned legacy batch-processing systems to real-time **Kafka pipelines**, ensuring data integrity for over 1 million daily transactions.
* **Technical Breadth:** Expert in Java, Python, and SQL, with a focus on high-availability cloud architectures.

### High Performance: The Hult 4x Winning Streak
Since starting my Master’s, I have applied my technical rigor to solve high-stakes business problems. I am a **4-time Business Challenge Winner**, consistently ranking in the **top 3%** for Finance Advisory. 

* **Climate Risk:** Engineered an automated ESG data pipeline that reduced manual collection time by **90%**.
* **AI Innovation:** Won 1st Place in the **Aparavi Innovation Challenge** for architectural excellence in RAG development.



### Technical Toolkit
* **Languages:** Python, Java, SQL, R.
* **Data & AI:** LangChain, Weaviate (Vector DB), Spark, Kafka, Power BI, Tableau.
* **Cloud:** AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda), Hugging Face.

### Beyond the Code
When I’m not building data pipelines, you’ll find me exploring the Boston food scene, following the NBA and Premier League, or experimenting with my Moka Pot for the perfect cup of coffee.
